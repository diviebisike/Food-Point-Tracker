Files should be .jsx
function ComponentName(){
    return <div> name </div>;
}

export default ComponentName



To use: in app.jsx do import ComponentName from "./components/ComponentName";

then to use do <ComponentName />



const [nameOfState, function that we are naming to change the value of previous parameter] = useState(initial state like none)
--> like reg var but when it is changed react knows to rerender page


can do array by doing
const answers = [yes, yes, no];
